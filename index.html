<h1>About me</h1>
<br>
<p>I'm Jess, I'm a Physics graduate from the UK, currently finishing up a Professional Certificate in Data Analytics. I've recently been working a local company to create analytic dashboard for them. My recent personal projects, though, have more focused around tracking my progress through certain large games that I play, and otherwise using said games as an excuse to graph and plot data to further my expertise with programs that I am finding I use in my work. My goal is to use the Data Analytics course as well as the work experience in the industry I am currently amassing to springboard into a job working with programs and data that I enjoy.</p>
